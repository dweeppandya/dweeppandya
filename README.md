- 👋 Hi, I’m @dweeppandya. I currently work as a Data Scientist in a leading FinTech company fighting Financial Crimes.
- 👀 I’m an explorer, always looking for the next challenge. Coding to me is a stress-buster. 
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the vast meadows of data science and decision intelligence. Specifically, I'm working on using GANs and HPO algorithms to solve optimization problems. I'm also currently in the process of articulating what I learn through blogs/articles (links will be posted here soon!)
- 💞️ I'd love to collaborate with you on any project/idea that involves optimization or that helps anybody in need. 
- 📫 Feel free to drop a note here:
