# About

- 👋 Hi, I’m @dweeppandya. I currently work as a Data Scientist at [Ecolibrium](https://ecolibrium.io/) helping institutes achieve their carbon net-zero goals and leading de-carbonization efforts with data! 🌳
- Previously I've worked with a leading FinTech to help catch the bad guys from doing bad things, specifically in the Anti-Money Laundering and Fraud Detection domains. 🏦
- 👀 I’m an explorer, always looking for the next challenge. Coding to me is a stress-buster. 
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the vast meadows of data science and decision intelligence. I'm also currently in the process of articulating what I learn through blogs/articles (checkout [my website](https://dweeppandya.github.io/thisisdweep/))
- 💞️ I'd love to collaborate with you on any project/idea that helps anybody in need.
